# pwa-kit-style-loader 🌩️

Enable vanilla CSS 🍦 support in Salesforce PWA Kit — instantly.

`pwa-style-loader` is a lightweight CLI that adds global CSS capability to Salesforce PWA Kit projects safely and quickly.

Built for simplicity and enterprise environments.

Instead of manually configuring build files and risking setup issues, this CLI enables CSS support in one command.

## ⚡ Usage

```bash
npm install pwa-style-loader
npx pwa-style-loader
```
